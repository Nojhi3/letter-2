                                    Hi Grown-Up Lady,<br /><br />

                                    ðŸŒ·HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY PRITI ðŸŒ·<br />
                                    Damn the gifts in Hong Kong would cost me my laptop. Just a little thing for you.<br />
                                    Since I couldnâ€™t send you gifts and hugs,<br />
                                    Iâ€™m genuinely so proud of you... for holding it all together, for making things work, for growing into the incredible woman you are becoming.<br />
                                    And I always will beâ€¦ no matter what you do, no matter where life takes you.<br /><br />

                                    Life has pulled us far apart in distance. We donâ€™t share everyday updates anymore â€” not like before.<br />
                                    But deep down, I know... weâ€™re all fighting our little battles, carrying our silent storms.<br /><br />

                                    And Priti, even if weâ€™re not always in touchâ€¦<br />
                                    when the world feels too heavy, when you're troubled or tired â€” just know, weâ€™ll always be here.<br />
                                    Come to us when you need someone.<br />
                                    Come to us even when you donâ€™t.<br /><br />

                                    Thatâ€™s what this bond is â€” to me, thatâ€™s the purest form of friendship. And it always will be.
                                </p>

                                <p className="text-left text-lg font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                                    I hope, baby, that everything you dream of â€” every little wish on your bucket list â€” finds its way to you.<br />
                                    That you stay healthy, surrounded by people who love you the way you deserve to be loved... like the princess you are.<br />
                                    And if life throws something difficult your way, I hope it doesnâ€™t break you down â€” but builds you into someone even stronger.<br />
                                    May you always stand tall for yourself, with grace and fire in your heart.
                                </p>
